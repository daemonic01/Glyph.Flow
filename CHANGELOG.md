## [v0.1.0a6](../../releases/tag/v0.1.0a6) – 2025-08-28
*Major improvements to logging and presentation.*

### ✨ Added

- Clean separation of system log (status/errors) vs. presenter log (command results).

## [v0.1.0a5](../../releases/tag/v0.1.0a5) – 2025-08-22
*Big refactor: Command Registry system introduced.*

- Command addition now requires only a registry entry + handler function.
- `clearall` command refactor: no parameters, delete all data.
