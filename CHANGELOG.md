## [v0.1.1](../../releases/tag/v0.1.1) – 2025-09-14

### 🔧 Improved
- Switching a node structure now also has an upward effect. When all internal nodes are completed, the one above them will also be ready.

### 🐛 Fixed
- The `test` command now runs on a sandbox data file, so it doesn't affect project structures that have already been created.


## [v0.1.0](../../releases/tag/v0.1.0) – 2025-09-12
*The first non-alpha release, which introduces automated testing, introduces simpler theme management, and creates a stable foundation for future development.*

### ✨ Added
- Added `bigsample` command to expand testing capabilities.
- Added `test` command for automatically test file integrity, configuration, and command functionality.
- Added new simple themes (crimson, arctic, desert) and a Hotkey (T) to change between them.
- Added a `data info field` to the right of the header with the number of all, completed and ongoing projects.
- Added `theme` key to config so that the last used theme is saved after exiting the app.
- Introduced **footer help bar** showing available hotkeys. It becomes highlighted when the hotkeys are active (outside input field).

### 🔧 Improved
- Minor improvements in command handlers.
- Updated internal messages.

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed PDF export issue with CJK/Cyrillic characters.
