# Glyph.Flow

**Glyph.Flow** is a minimalist, keyboard-driven TUI workflow manager built with Python and [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual).  
It allows you to define hierarchical structures such as projects, phases, tasks, and subtasks, and manage them directly from the terminal.

This is an early prototype (v0.1.0a6), mainly focused on backend data modeling and command parsing.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Layered logging system with message catalog (`log.key`, `log.help`)
- Unified system messages with INFO/WARNING/ERROR/SUCCESS/DEBUG/HELP levels
- Command history navigation (Up/Down arrows)
- Universal tree structure based on a flexible `Node` class
- Unique hierarchical segmented ID generation for all nodes
- Type-checked schema (e.g. Project > Phase > Task > Subtask)
- JSON-based save/load of full node trees
- TUI-based test interface using `Textual`
- Command-based interaction for early testing: `create`, `edit`, `delete`, `search`, `clearall`, `save`, etc.
- Rich output: tree view, table view, ASCII rendering
- Interactive confirmation for destructive operations (`delete`, `clearall`)
- Help text loaded from external file for easier maintenance
- Layered and leveled logging and internal messaging system with buffer prepared for lcalization.
- Retrievable command history of the last 50 unique commands (Arrow keys in the input field.)
- All commands are declaratively defined in a command registry system.
- Dual-log system: 'log' for system/runtime messages and 'presenter' for visual command outputs.
- Live updated configuration information in the header.

## 📂 File Structure
- `node.py` – Core Node class with hierarchy and progress logic
- `schema.py` – Enforces expected child types
- `data_io.py` – Load/save trees and generate sample data
- `parser.py` – Command-line argument parsers for various commands
- `message_styler.py` - Advanved internal message system.
- `log.py` - Log system that handles internal messages and external logging.
- `command_history.py` - Retrieveable command history of the last 50 unique commands.
- `config_loader.py` - Utility functions that handle external config.
- `context.py` - Real time global available data for operations.
- `/controllers` - Command registry system.
- `/handlers, /presenters, /services` - Clear handler function system for the command registry.
- `app.py` – Textual-based TUI frontend for testing

## 🧭 Roadmap Highlights
- Planned for future versions:
  - Improved scheme system
  - Advanced `search` filters (by type, regex, etc.)
  - Detailed TUI interface with main menu, project view, settings, and changelog
  - Undo support
  - Enhanced error handling
  - TUI Features, Dashboard and statistics

## 🛠 Status
This is an early preview. Not production ready yet.  
For now, it serves as a foundation for future versions of Glyph.Flow.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `textual`, `rich`

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install textual rich
python app.py
```

Use the input field to enter commands (see below).

---

### 💻 Commands

#### Core
- `help`                          – Print all available commands with examples (loaded from external file)
- `sample`                        – Generate a demo tree
- `ls`                            – List root nodes
- `tree`                          – Print indented tree view
- `ascii`                         – Print ASCII-style hierarchy
- `table`                         – Show nodes in table format
- `save`                          – Save tree to `node_data.json`
- `schema`                        – Set a new node hierarchy (e.g. `schema Level1 Level2 Level3 Level4`)

#### Node Management
- `create`                        – Create node (e.g. `create Task "Refactor Logic" --desc "Cleanup" --full "Split backend and UI" --parent 01.01`)
- `edit`                          – Edit an existing node (e.g. `edit 01.02 --name "New Name" --desc "Short" --full "Detailed" --deadline 2025-08-15`)
- `delete`                        – Schedule deletion (e.g. `delete 01.01.01`)
- `confirm delete <id>`           – Confirm a pending delete

#### Search & Filters
- `search <substring>`            – Search by name (case-insensitive)
- `search name <substring>`       – Explicit name search
- `search id <prefix>`             – Search by exact or prefix ID

#### Bulk Operations
- `toggle <id>`                   – Toggle a node and all its children between done/undone
- `clearall`                      – Clear all in-memory nodes (requires confirmation)
- `save`                          - Save project tree manually.


#### Config Operations
- `config <setting> <on/off>`     - Turn auto-save / confirmation requests / logging on and off.          * NEW *
- `autosave <on/off>`             - Turn auto-save on and off.

### 💡 Usage examples
- `sample` → `ls` → `table` / `tree` / `ascii`
- `create Project "New Project"` → `ls` → `create Phase "Planning"`
- `sample` → `table` → `delete 01.01` → `confirm delete 01.01` → `table`
- `sample` → `table` → `toggle 01.01` → `table`
- `search plan` → list all nodes with “plan” in the name
- `clearall` → remove all data after confirmation
