# Glyph.Flow

**Glyph.Flow** is a minimalist, keyboard-driven TUI workflow manager built with Python and [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual).  
It allows you to define hierarchical structures such as projects, phases, tasks, and subtasks, and manage them directly from the terminal.

This is an early prototype (v0.1.0a8), mainly focused on backend data modeling and command parsing.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Layered logging system with message catalog (`log.key`, `log.help`)
- Unified system messages with INFO/WARNING/ERROR/SUCCESS/DEBUG/HELP levels
- Command history navigation (Up/Down arrows)
- Universal tree structure based on a flexible `Node` class
- Unique hierarchical segmented ID generation for all nodes
- Type-checked schema (e.g. Project > Phase > Task > Subtask)
- JSON-based save/load of full node trees
- TUI-based test interface using `Textual`
- Command-based interaction for early testing: `create`, `edit`, `delete`, `search`, `clearall`, `save`, `move`, etc.
- Rich output: tree view, table view, ASCII rendering
- Interactive confirmation for destructive operations (`delete`, `clearall`)
- Help text loaded from external file for easier maintenance
- Layered and leveled logging and internal messaging system with buffer prepared for lcalization.
- Retrievable command history of the last 50 unique commands (Arrow keys in the input field.)
- All commands are declaratively defined in a command registry system.
- Dual-log system: 'log' for system/runtime messages and 'presenter' for visual command outputs.
- Live updated configuration information in the header.
- Memory friendly undo/redo feature.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure
- `node.py` â€“ Core Node class with hierarchy and progress logic
- `schema.py` â€“ Enforces expected child types
- `data_io.py` â€“ Load/save trees and generate sample data
- `message_styler.py` - Advanved internal message system.
- `log.py` - Log system that handles internal messages and external logging.
- `command_history.py` - Retrieveable command history of the last 50 unique commands.
- `config_loader.py` - Utility functions that handle external config.
- `context.py` - Real time global available data for operations.
- `/controllers` - Command registry system.
- `/handlers, /presenters, /services` - Clear handler function system for the command registry.
- `app.py` â€“ Textual-based TUI frontend for testing

---

## ðŸ§­ Roadmap Highlights
- Planned for future versions:
  - Improved scheme system
  - Advanced `search` filters (by type, regex, etc.)
  - Detailed TUI interface with main menu, project view, settings, and changelog
  - Undo support
  - Enhanced error handling
  - TUI Features, Dashboard and statistics

- `edit`                          â€“ Edit an existing node (e.g. `edit 01.02 --name "New Name" --desc "Short" --full "Detailed" --deadline 2025-08-15`)
- `delete`                        â€“ Schedule deletion (e.g. `delete 01.01.01`)
- `confirm delete <id>`           â€“ Confirm a pending delete
- `toggle <id>`                   â€“ Toggle a node and all its children between done/undone
- `move <id> <target_id>`         - Move a node below another node (level sensitive). Root can't be moved.          * NEW *

#### Search & Filters
- `search <substring>`            â€“ Search by name (case-insensitive)
- `search name <substring>`       â€“ Explicit name search
- `search id <prefix>`             â€“ Search by exact or prefix ID

#### Bulk Operations
- `clearall`                      â€“ Clear all in-memory nodes (requires confirmation)
- `save`                          - Save project tree manually.


#### Config Operations
- `config <setting> <on/off>`     - Turn auto-save / confirmation requests / logging on and off.
- `autosave <on/off>`             - Turn auto-save on and off.
